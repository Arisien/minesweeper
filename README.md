Minesweeper++ is a C++ implementation of Minesweeper. Currently, it has a CLI interface but that might change in the future. If you would like to contribute feel free to submit a pull request.

## Todo

* Improve the menu (options selected with arrow keys)
* Make the board customizable (custom width, height, bomb amount)
* Ability to enter custom seed (not random)
* Implement unicode character support (eg. üè≥ for flag)
* Implement arrow keys movement instead of plotting coordinates (maybe keep both as options)
* Redo UI to be more usable
* Remove the `rlutil.h` dependency, rewrite the functionality it serves.
